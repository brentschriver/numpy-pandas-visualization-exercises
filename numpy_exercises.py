# Exercise 2 - Make a variable named min_of_a to hold the minimum of all the numbers in the above list

# Exercise 3 - Make a variable named max_of_a to hold the max number of all the numbers in the above list
max_of_a = a.max()

# Exercise 4 - Make a variable named mean_of_a to hold the average of all the numbers in the above list

# Exercise 5 - Make a variable named product_of_a to hold the product of multiplying all the numbers in the above list together

# Exercise 6 - Make a variable named squares_of_a. It should hold each number in a squared like [1, 4, 9, 16, 25...]
